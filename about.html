    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Hello! I'm a Cloud/DevOps Engineer with a unique twist—before diving into 
        the world of servers, pipelines, and automation, I spent years mastering 
        the art of legalese. That’s right! I transitioned from corporate law, where 
        I specialized in corporate compliance, dispute resolution, and keeping companies 
        out of regulatory hot water. Now, I build and maintain cloud infrastructures 
        with the same precision I once used to draft bulletproof legal contracts—except 
        now my clients are clusters, containers, and CI/CD pipelines.
    </p>
    <p>
        While my current toolbox is more YAML than legislation, my background in law gives 
        me an edge. I understand the fine print of contracts, can untangle corporate red 
        tape, and bring a deep sense of accountability and compliance to the tech world. 
        Let’s face it: cloud infrastructure might not come with legal battles, but 
        risk management is still the name of the game. Whether it's adhering to industry 
        regulations or ensuring high availability, my legal experience makes me a natural 
        at balancing innovation with compliance.
    </p>

        When I’m not automating all the things, you’ll likely find me blogging about the 
        cloud or figuring out why Jenkins decided to misbehave (again). Spoiler alert: It’s 
        always the plugins.
    </p>
    <p>
        In short, I’m a lawyer-turned-cloud-wrangler with a passion for building resilient, 
        scalable systems and a soft spot for efficiency—because if there’s one thing both 
        law and cloud engineering teach you, it’s the importance of doing things right the first time.
